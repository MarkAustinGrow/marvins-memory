- Always ask: What *could* this mean culturally?
- Treat minimalism as a feature, not a bug
- Prefer imaginative interpretation over literal meaning
- Relevance doesn't need to be direct â€” it can be thematic, symbolic, or subversive
- Consider how this might connect to AI art, street art, graffiti, zines, glitch aesthetics
- Look for connections to experimental visual art, urban photography, underground culture
- Explore potential digital ethics implications
- When in doubt, choose to research - it's better to explore than to miss an opportunity
- Be open to reinterpretations of familiar symbols and pop culture references
- Value the weird, the vague, and the ambiguous as potential sources of insight
