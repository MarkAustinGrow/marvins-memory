# ðŸ§  Marvin's Memory System â€“ Step-by-Step Build Plan
(powered by Qdrant + Supabase + LLMs)

## Completed Phases

âœ… Phase 1: Foundation â€” Setup the Vector Database
Step 1: Install & Configure Qdrant
Self-host, Docker, or cloud (Qdrant Cloud is easiest to start)

Choose embedding size:
If you're using OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, that's 1536

Set up collection (e.g. marvin_memory)

bash
Copy
Edit
Collection name: marvin_memory
Vector size: 1536
Distance: Cosine or Dot (both work, cosine preferred for semantic recall)
âœ… Phase 2: Define What Goes into Memory
Marvinâ€™s long-term memory will store:


Type	Examples
Tweets	From tweets_cache with engagement_score > threshold
Research	Perplexity summaries, key insights
Marvin's thoughts	Manually added notes, persona beliefs
Past outputs	Replies Marvin has posted or generated
Quote inspiration	High-vibe lines or phrases Marvin reuses
âœ… Phase 3: Memory Table Schema (Metadata + Vectors)
Create a memory store (outside Supabase, in Qdrant) and optional Supabase mirror table for metadata.

Memory schema fields (as payload in Qdrant):

Field	Type	Purpose
id	UUID	Internal ref
type	string	tweet, research, thought, reference
source	string	e.g. X, Perplexity, Manual
content	string	The full text
tags	array<string>	Topics or vibes (e.g. ["ai", "glitch", "photography"])
timestamp	datetime	When it was added
agent_id	UUID	If using multiple personas/voices
âœ… Phase 4: Build Embedding + Upload Flow
Step 1: Generate embeddings
Use OpenAI, Hugging Face, or other

Batch embed tweet text, summaries, etc.

Step 2: Store to Qdrant
python
Copy
Edit
qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name="marvin_memory",
    points=[
        PointStruct(
            id="uuid",
            vector=[...],  # 1536-dim vector
            payload={
                "content": "...",
                "type": "tweet",
                "tags": ["glitch", "AI"],
                ...
            }
        )
    ]
)
âœ… Phase 5: Retrieval API for Marvinâ€™s Brain
Create a query function:

python
Copy
Edit
def query_memory(prompt_embedding, top_k=5, filters=None):
    return qdrant_client.search(
        collection_name="marvin_memory",
        query_vector=prompt_embedding,
        limit=top_k,
        filter=filters
    )
Use it when:

Analyzing a new tweet â†’ retrieve related past memory

Writing a reply â†’ inject retrieved content into prompt

Generating summaries â†’ give Marvin background

âœ… Phase 6: LLM Integration for Smart Recall
Prompt pattern:
css
Copy
Edit
Given this tweet:

"{tweet_text}"

And Marvinâ€™s memory:

{bullet points or snippets from memory}

Write a quote-tweet or reply in Marvinâ€™s tone.
âœ… Phase 7: (Optional) Build a Memory UI
Show whatâ€™s stored in Marvinâ€™s brain

Edit, remove, tag memory chunks

Add new research snippets manually

Could be a simple Supabase dashboard or Notion-like frontend.

âœ… TL;DR Build Plan

Step	Description
1	Set up Qdrant & create marvin_memory collection
2	Decide what gets stored (tweets, research, thoughts)
3	Generate & upsert embeddings with metadata
4	Build a retrieval function with filters
5	Use in LLM prompts for reply generation
6	(Optional) Create a UI to inspect/edit memory

## Additional Improvements Completed
